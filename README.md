# Proyecto Herzwerk is my first serious web project. It is dedicated to spread the lyrics translations of the German rock band "Megaherz" to Spanish speaking countries.
The technologies used in creating this page were HTML, CSS and Javascript. You can visit it under https://proyecto-herzwerk.site 

The translations are set as subtitles in you tube videos due to the fact that it's easier to read them while listening to Megaherz's music
The music and the pictures used in creating the videos are completely property of Megaherz.  The German - Spanish translations are made by myself.
